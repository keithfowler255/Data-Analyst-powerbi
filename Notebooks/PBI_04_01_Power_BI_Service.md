## Create Dashboard by Pining Visualizations

1. Pin the **treemap chart**, **the scatter chart**, and the **map** visualization from the Sales Report tab to the **VanArsdel Sales** dashboard.
1. Go to the **Yearly Trend** tab and pin the **waterfall chart** that shows the **Sales Var by Year** to the VanArsdel Sales dashboard.
1. Go to the VanArsdel Sales dashboard and review what you have created.
1. Resize and arrange the tiles as necessary.
1. Go to **Edit** > Click on **Mobile Layout** > Observe how it looks in mobile > In the Right Side corner Click on **Web Layout** to see how it looks in web/laptops

- **Note:** If the original visualization that's used to create the tile changes, the tile doesn't change. For example, if you pin a line chart from a report and then you change the line chart to a bar chart, the dashboard tile continues to show a line chart. The data refreshes, but the visualization type doesn't.
